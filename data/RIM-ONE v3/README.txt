GENERAL INFORMATION

This database has been built by the Medical Image Analysis Group of the University of La Laguna.
The website of the group is http://medimrg.webs.ull.es/

The database is the third release of RIM-ONE, the Retinal IMage database for Optic Nerve Evaluation. It consists of 159 stereo retinal fundus images with 
optic disc and cup ground truth. The reference segmentations have been provided by two experts in ophthalmology from the Hospital Universitario de 
Canarias using the tool DCSeg, also available in our website.


DATABASE ORGANIZATION

The database is organized into 3 folders:
	- Healthy: this folder contains the stereo images and reference segmentations of the healthy subjects.
	- Glaucoma and suspects: this folder contains the stereo images and reference segmentations of the confirmed glaucoma patients and the glaucoma suspects.
	- Scripts: this folder contains the Matlab scripts needed to evaluate the reference segmentations of the database and reproduce our results.


USAGE TERMS

You are free to use this database and the Matlab functions and scripts for research purposes, but you should not redistribute any of them without our consent.

The paper describing this database and DCSeg tool has been sent for publication and is undergoing review in an international conference.

In the meantime, if you present or publish results that are based on this database or segmentation tool, please cite the paper shown below:
