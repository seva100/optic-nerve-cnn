
ABOUT THE OPTIC NERVE CONTOUR TRACED BY THE EXPERTS
===================================================

For each image, two experts traced the optic nerve contour. Each contour 
is based in a sequence of 36 points and is stored in a file:
 
 anotExpert1_XXX.txt for the expert_1

 anotExpert2_XXX.txt for the expert_2

where 'XXX' is the image number. Each file contains 36 rows and 2 columns, 
therefore each row stores the X and Y coordinates of each point belonging
to a contour.
