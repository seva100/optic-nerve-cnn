## Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation Methods with U-Net

*Note: the codebase is deprecated. It would require significant refactoring for newly released keras and tensorflow versions, however, due to the lack of time I am unable to do that continuously. Feel free to fork the repository to make any changes.*

This repository contains code in support of the paper: ["Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation Methods for Glaucoma Detection with Modification of U-Net Convolutional Neural Network"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00979), available in several versions:
